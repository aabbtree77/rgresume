## Setup

These are the LaTeX files for my résumé and curriculum vitae (cv).

If you want to modify them, you first need to install [LaTeX.](https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-install-latex-on-ubuntu-20-04-focal-fossa-linux)
Then simply run the shell scripts:

```console
./main_cv.sh
./main_resume.sh
```

## Credits

I learned LaTeX in the years 1999-2008 mostly from D. Sc. Jorma Laaksonen who was my thesis instructor at Helsinki University of Technology (HUT, TKK, Aalto University), and I still used it heavily around 2012 and 2014, but then forgot most of it. A given LaTeX file/template is really all one needs 
to get started though.

These particular shell scripts were given to me by ‪Davide Eynard in the year 2014. He was doing research at USI, Lugano and also 
helping me a lot with all sorts of matters, including lending a heater to ease a cold Swiss winter.

The LaTeX way of writing documents is very solid, but also tedious. It is better to be less pedantic and write directly in Markdown. It is good enough, instant publishing with github, Google fonts, can easily update and remove things, no paywalls, better search. The world is changing: arXiv/Hal or just github, [Alexandra Elbakyan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandra_Elbakyan).

To Do: Try [reStructuredText](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2017/restructuredtext-vs-markdown-for-technical-documentation/) some day.
